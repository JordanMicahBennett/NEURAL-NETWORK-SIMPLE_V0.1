# NEURAL-NETWORK-SIMPLE_V0.1

  Why?: This is practice writing of basic neural network from memory. I do this at the end of each year, or sometimes every 6 months, for practice of fundamentals.

  The problem space is X-OR inputs. So the model does xor input prediction.
  
  Given two numbers in X-OR space, the model will try to guess the output.
  
  For:
  
  a) Input=(0,0) output should be 0
  
  b) Input=(1,0) output should be 1
  
  c) Input=(0,1) output should be 1
  
  d) Input=(1,1) output should be 0
